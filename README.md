A curious rover exploring patterns in the real world through logic, science, and rational thinking.

I’m **Agrim Sharma**, based in Uttar Pradesh, India 🇮🇳 — passionate about building systems that are **humane, aesthetic, and meaningful**.

I believe technology should not only work, but also *improve how humans think, learn, and live.*
